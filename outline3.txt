- what is git + "show of hands" re: experience
- - "checkpoints for your save files"

- why
- - professionally expected, for a reason
- - easy data backups
- - facilitates collaboration
- - helps for documentation
- - frees you to experiment

- methods
- - can learn "click here, then here, to do X"
